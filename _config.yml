# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Hi, I'm John Black. I am a data analyst who loves telling stories. I believe that data analysis is more than just crunching numbers - it's about finding the stories hidden within the data and using them to make beter decisions. I believe that by telling these stories, we can make data more accessible and understandable for everyone.
